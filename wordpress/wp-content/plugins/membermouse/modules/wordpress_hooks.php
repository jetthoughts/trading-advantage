		<p>Hooks and filters are provided by WordPress to allow your plugin to 'hook into' the rest of WordPress; that is, to call 
		functions in your plugin at specific times, and thereby set your code in motion. MemberMouse defines its own
		set of hooks and filters that you can utilize to 'hook into' MemberMouse so you can call functions in your code when specific
		events occur in MemberMouse.</p>
